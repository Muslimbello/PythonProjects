# Password Manager with Encryption

ðŸ”‘ Managing your password has never been easierðŸ˜‰

## Introduction

This Python program serves as a simple yet robust password manager, employing the Fernet symmetric key encryption from the cryptography library to ensure the security of stored passwords. The manager allows users to add new passwords or view existing ones in a secure and organized manner.

## Getting Started

To begin, you need to generate a unique encryption key. Uncomment and run the Key_gen() function provided in the code. This key is crucial for encrypting and decrypting your passwords and is saved in a file named key.key.

# Dependencies

This password manager relies on the cryptography library for Fernet encryption. To install the necessary dependencies, you can use:

```bash
#  Example to install the cryptocraphy library
pip install cryptography
```
## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the password manager project directory.
3. Run the main.py script.

```bash
# Example command to run
python main.py
# or for linux users
python3 main.py
```
